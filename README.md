## Introduction
### üåü Three distinct problem-solving modes
-  **Backward Tracing**: trace back to past events to answer the question.
-  **Real-Time Visual Perception**: understand and respond to events as they unfold at the current timestamp.
-  **Forward Active Responding**: delay the response until sufficient future information becomes available to answer the question accurately.

### üí´Chain-of-Time Thinking Process
OVO-Bench evaluates Video-LLMs' ability to find temporal visual clues from ongoing input, allowing models to wait for sufficient evidence before responding. We term this approach the Video Chain-of-Time thinking process, analogous to Chain-of-Thought reasoning in LLMs.

## Evaluation Pipeline

### Requirements
Following modules are required for inference and scoring pipeline.
```txt
moviepy==1.0.3
numpy
pillow
tqdm
```
Or run `pip insall -r requirements` to install all required modules.

### Data Preparation
- Download src videos and chunk videos locally: 
  1. Download `src_videos.tar.parta[a~e]`(~44GB) from [huggingface-repo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JoeLeelyf/OVO-Bench)
  2. Place it under `./data`  and then concat and untar all files
  3. Run `bash scripts/chunk_video.sh` to get all chunked video clips.
- (Recommend) Downloaded our pre-chunked video clips:
  1. Download `chunked_videos.tar.parta[a~o]`(~144GB) from [huggingface-repo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JoeLeelyf/OVO-Bench)
  2. Place it under `./data` and then concat and untar all files.

### Inference and Score
We divide our evaluation pipeline into two parts: `inference` and `score`. For our released models, run our provided scripts under `./scripts` directory. For example, for InternVL2, run:
```bash
bash scripts/inference/Gemini.sh
```
All inference results will be saved under `./results/[MODEL_NAME]`. Then run our scoring scripts:
```bash
bash scripts/score/Gemini.sh
```
Scores will show in cli:
```txt
Offline Model: Gemini
Evaluate Backward Tracing...
Task: ASI, Acc: 76.35
Task: HLD, Acc: 52.69
Task: EPM, Acc: 58.59
Backward Avg.: 62.54

Evaluate Real-time Visual Perception...
Task: ATR, Acc: 79.31
Task: ACR, Acc: 66.97
Task: OCR, Acc: 85.91
Task: STU, Acc: 58.43
Task: OJR, Acc: 61.96
Task: FPD, Acc: 63.37
Realtime Avg.: 69.32

Evaluate Forward Active Responding...
Task: REC, Acc: 35.53
Task: SSR, Acc: 74.24
Task: CRR, Acc: 61.67
Forward Avg.: 57.15

Total Avg.: 63.00
```
To evaluate your own models, inherit `OVOBenchOffline/Online` class in `./utils/OVOBench.py` and implement your own inference pipeline. Refer to our provided models under `./models` for further details.
